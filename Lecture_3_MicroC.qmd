## From Biases to Nudges



- Recall that a bias is: 
  - "An inclination towards a position or conclusion" <font size=4.5>[@reber_penguin_2001, p. 88]</font size>

  - A tendency to:
      + act in a particular way
      + make judgements in a particular way

  - An error in reasoning <font size=4.5>[@eysenck_cognitive_2005, p. 512]</font size>

- In some cases a bias is the "failure" of a heuristic judgement
  - A heuristic applied in the wrong context


## From Biases to Nudges



- Heuristics and biases linked by similarities in underlying cognitive mechanisms

- Errors in applying heuristics manifest as biases
  - These biases led to the discovery of specific heuristics
      - (e.g., representativeness / availability)
  
- Study of heuristics and biases informed our understanding of how people think
  - <font color="5284bd">Dual-process</font>/<font color="2FAACE">Dual-systems</font> Theories

## Fly in the Urinal{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam
- Fly etched into each urinal
- "Spillage" reduced by $80\%$ [@thaler_nudge_2008]

<br>

- Variations in other airports
  - A soccer goal equipped with a ball during the World Cup

<br>

- "Fly in the urinal has become the perfect exemplar of a nudge"<br>[@thaler_misbehaving_2015, p. 252]
:::

## Defining Nudges{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- "A nudge is some small feature in the environment that attracts our attention and influences behavior" [@thaler_misbehaving_2015, p. 252]


- "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way
  - without forbidding any options
  - or significantly changing their economic incentives" [@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 6]
  
- Must be easy and cheap to avoid

- Nudges are not mandates:
  - Putting the fruit at eye level counts as a nudge
  - Banning junk food does not  <br>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 6]

:::

## Defining Nudges and "Better Choices"

- Libertarian Paternalism

- Paternalism but "free to choose"

- Aim of Libertarian Paternalism is to:
  - “influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, <font color="#990000">***as judged by themselves***</font>”

:::{.incremental}

- Slightly more invasive than other nudges<br><font size=4.5>(may not even count as a nudge)</font>
- Hospitals introduced a surgical checklist during major operations
- 8 Cities Globally: Ifakara (Tanzania), Manila (Philippines), New Delhi (India), Amman (Jordan), Seattle (United States of America), Toronto (Canada), London (United Kingdom) and Auckland (New Zealand)
- Data were from $7,688$ patients
  - $3,733$ before and $3,955$ after checklist was introduced
- Incidences of major complications fell by $\frac{1}{3}$ ($11\%$ to $7\%$)
- $40\%$ Drop in in-patient deaths ($1.5\%$ to $0.8\%$)

# Nudges and Theory

## Nudges and Theory

:::{.incremental}

- Nudges are designed to exploit features of our decision making
  - e.g., appealing to loss aversion in persuasion
- The remaining nudges described will be linked with specific theoretical underpinnings
  - Exploiting specific biases
  - Tailored for specific heuristics
  - Appealing to other features of decision making
  
:::

## Activity



- In groups, Identify the underlying theory behind the nudges discussed
  - What heuristics/biases do they harness?
  - Is there any other concept covered that might be relevant? <br> (some may not have been covered yet, but you can guess)

- Fly; Cooker; Donating organs; Checklist


## Activity (possible answers)

- Fly (focusing attention: combating "mindless"/"autopilot" behaviour)
- Cooker (path of least resistance / cognitive ease)
- Donating organs (Default heuristic)
- Checklist (combating "mindless"/"autopilot" choosing)

## Principles relevant to Nudges {.smaller}

- Choice architecture [@thaler_choice_2012]
- Path of least resistance
- Heuristics: Anchoring / Availability / Representativeness
- Biases: Optimism / over-confidence / Status-quo bias
- Loss aversion
- Emotion / affect / mood
  - *Hot* vs *cold* decisions 
- "mindless" or "autopilot" choosing
- (Mental Accounting)


## Choice Architecture

- **Choice architecture** is the "context in which people make decisions" <br>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 3]

- Everything matters

- No such thing as "neutral design"


[@thaler_choice_2012]
 
 
## Choice Architecture

- 6 principles of good choice architecture
  - iNcentives
  - Understand mappings
  - Defaults
  - Give feedback
  - Expect error
  - Structure complex choices

[@thaler_choice_2012]


## Path of Least Resistance (Defaults){.smaller}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}


- Easier choice options are preferable to more difficult options
- Consider the placing of items near a till in a shop
- Sweets and crisps could be replaced with healthy snacks/fruit
  - This would lead to people choosing healthy snacks more often
- Too many choices makes decisions more difficult

## Heuristics: Anchoring{.smaller}



- Recall Anchoring (heuristics lecture)
- Taking information salient in the environment and using it to *anchor* your decisions

- e.g., rigged wheel of fortune: 10 or 65
  - Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just wrote?
  - What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?

- Mean response 25% and 45% (depending on 10 or 65)


  - In groups/individually:
      - Identify potential applications of anchoring <br> (1-2 mins)
      


## Heuristics: Anchoring Applications



- Charities looking for donations:
  - Suggested amounts serve as an anchor
  - €100, €250, €1,000, €5,000
  <br>
  - *vs* €50, €75, €100, and €150

- The more you ask for the more you get
  - e.g., court cases for compensation/damages 

## Heuristics: Availability



- the process of judging frequency by “the ease with which instances come to mind”<br><font size=4.5>[@kahneman_thinking_2011, p. 128]</font size>

- Remind people of a salient (negative) incident and they will over-estimate the risk
  - and you can sell more insurance policies


## Heuristics: Combatting Availability{.smaller}


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="77%"}


- Availability has been blamed for alcohol misuse
  - "everyone does it"
      - leading to more people drinking


- Large scale educational campaign in Montana stressed that majority of citizens do not drink
  - “*Most (81 percent) of Montana college students have four or fewer alcoholic drinks each week.*”
  - “*Most (70 percent) of Montana teens are tobacco free.*”
- The strategy has produced big improvements in the accuracy of social perceptions 
  - also statistically significant decreases in smoking<br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 68; @linkenbachMontanaModelDevelopment2003; @linkenbachMOSTUsAre2003]</font>

## Heuristics: Representativeness



<br>


- judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind.


## Map of London: V-1 rocket strikes (WWII)

<font size=4.5>[@thaler_nudge_2008, pp. 28-29; @gilovich_how_1993]</font>

## Heuristics: Representativeness

:::{.incremental}

- Seeing patterns when they are not there

- bombings appear to be around the Thames, and in the north west<br>(German spies in the blank spaces?)
  - but they are random

- Illusion of a "Hot hand" or a "Streak" in basketball <br>[@thaler_nudge_2008; @gilovich_hot_1985]

:::

## Optimism



- Optimism bias / over-confidence bias
  - lead to the planning fallacy
- Activity:
  - Identify strategies that may combat the planning fallacy
      - does any of your strategies count as a *nudge*

## Status-quo Bias

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="80%"}

- "strong tendency to go along with the status-quo or default option" <br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 8]</font>

- New cell phone: default options

- Private companies or public officials think that one policy produces better outcomes, they can greatly influence the outcome by choosing it as the default<br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 8]</font>

- Saving money

![](resources/images/phone_settings.jpg "phone"){.lightbox width=450px}

## Loss Aversion



- Advertising framed in terms of losses

<br> 

- e.g., “drink more water”:
  - “you sweat in the heat: you lose water.”

- Any other examples?

## Emotions / "hot" vs "cold"



- In a few weeks we'll learn that we are very bad at predicting how we will feel "in the moment"
  - Affective forecasting error

- How do we resist the urge to:
    - snack?

- Problems with smoking/alcohol
- Safe sex
- Excessive borrowing/Gambling?

## Emotions / "hot" vs "cold"



- Alter the "choice architecture"
  - Don't keep snacks in the fridge
      - Dinner party bowl of nuts [@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 40]
  - Don't go shopping on an empty stomach

## "mindless" or "autopilot" choosing


:::{.incremental}

- Accidentally driving towards work (on a Saturday)
- Stale popcorn
- Re-filling soup bowls <br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_nudge_2008, p. 43; @lopezVisualCuesFood2024]</font>

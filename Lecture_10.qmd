## Gambling and Economic Psychology

:::{.incremental}

- Mental Accounting example:
  - gamblers who have won some money early in the evening put that money into a different pocket from their ‘own’ money
  - each pocket is a separate mental account<br>[@thaler_mental_2003, p. 94]

## Winning through *brute force*


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}


- In $1990$ Stefan Klincewicz and Paddy Mulligan put together a $10$ man syndicate
  - Each person paid $£30$ over $10$ weeks 
  - Between them they won Lotto jackpot of $£2,439,760$ in April, $1990$<br><font size=4.5>[@collins_how_2017]</font>

## Winning through *brute force*{.smaller}


- In $1992$ Stefan Klincewicz and $28$ member Dublin-based syndicate
  - Filled out $243,474$ Lotto coupons in preparation
- The May Bank Holiday weekend $1992$ Jackpot was $£1.7$ $million$
- They bought over $80\%$ of the combinations (spending $\sim£820,000$ )
  - They had the winning numbers on the night
      - But two other winning tickets were also sold
      - Could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or $£568,682$
  - ***But*** Match-5 and match-4 prizes brought the syndicate's total winnings to approximately $£1,166,000$
      - profit of approximately $£310,000$



## Playing the Lottery{.smaller}


- The representativeness heuristic:
  - The winning numbers should look random
  - People likely avoid numbers that 'do not look random enough'
      - regular intervals or those that do not distribute sparsely across the whole range of possible numbers<br><font size=4.5>[@holtgraves_cognitive_1992; @baboushkin_underlying_2001]</font>

- Illusion of control:
  - Over estimate ability to choose winning numbers
  - *Gambler's Fallacy*:
      - avoiding numbers that have appeared recently<br><font size=4.5>[@wohl_deployment_2002; @langer_illusion_1975; @clotfelter_selling_1991]</font>
- Superstition <font size=4.5>[@ariyabuddhiphongs_test_2007]</font>



## Explaining the Lottery

- Suggestions?

## Explaining the Lottery{.smaller}



- Prospect Theory: People tend to overestimate low odds of winning
  - far lower than what people experience in everyday life
  - fail to estimate just how tiny they actually are <br><font size=4.5>[@kahneman_prospect_1979; @ranyard_economic_2018]</font>
- Availability heuristic: Salient wins <br><font size=4.5>[@tversky_availability_1973; @ranyard_economic_2018; see also Decision Sampling Theory, @stewart_decision_2006]</font>
- Social activity?
- Excitement?

  - Might miss the jackpot<br><font size=4.5>[@beckert_why_2013; @binde_why_2013 uploaded; @forrest_buying_2002]</font>


# Scratch Cards

## Scratch Cards

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}



- Low chance of winning high amounts
  - e.g.,  $1$ in $4,347,890$ chance of winning $£4$ $million$
- Reasonable chance of winning smaller amounts
  - e.g., $1$ in $6$ chance of winning $£10$
- Expected loss of $£3$ for every $£10$ spent

# Roulette

## Roulette{.smaller}


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}


- Transparent odds; Pure luck
- $37$ slots (Europe - $38$ in USA)
- Numbers from $0-36$
  - $\frac{1}{2}$ <font color="red">**Red**</font>
  - $\frac{1}{2}$ **Black**
- Can bet on a single slot or a selection
  - Payout for single number is $35$ to $1$

- Expected return is $36/37$  ($36/38$ in USA)

## Roulette

Explanations???

## Roulette

- Can lead to ***Loss Chasing***
  - Gamblers continue to gamble more after a loss
- A **Mental Account** for a gambling session
  - If they stop they 'close' the account at a **loss**
      - A 'sure' loss
  - Keeping the mental account open the loss is not *realised* (still a *paper* loss)
      - possibility of winning it back<br><font size=4.5>[@ranyard_economic_2018]</font>

# Fruit Machines

## Fruit Machines

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}


- Fruit machines are said to be most addictive form of gambling
  - It takes just over a year to become addicted
      - Takes over three years with traditional table games, such as roulette<br><font size=4.5>[@turner_how_2004]</font> 

- $3$ to $5$ to five reels with pictures

## Fruit Machines{.smaller}


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}


- The player inserts a coin and then pulls down a handle (or presses a button)
  - The reels spin
  - When they stop, the combination of pictures forms a certain pattern
  - If the combination comprises three pictures that are the same (or some other designated pattern), a reward is given.
  - The most common winning combination is 777
- The odds of fruit machines are unknown
  - Pure chance

## Fruit Machines and Near Misses


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}




- ***Near Misses***: a losing pattern that is very similar to a winning one
  - e.g., reels may stop at $776$ <br> very similar to $777$ 
- Gamblers feel that luck is with them and that success is on its way
  - Near-miss experiences tend to encourage more gambling <br><font size=4.5>[@griffiths_psychobiology_1991; @reid_psychology_1986]</font>

:::{.column width="35%"}

![](resources/images/fruity.gif){.lightbox}

:::

::::

## Explaining Near Misses{.smaller}


- Evolutionary explanations?
  - In natural environments to which we are adapted by evolution, a near miss may be close to a win
      - e.g., almost catching prey clearly indicates that prey is nearby and your skill levels are probably adequate to make a kill
  - May not hold for artificial environments ($776$ is not $nearly$ $777$)
- Near miss is mistaken for a gain
  - Same part of the brain<br><font size=4.5>[@clark_gambling_2009]</font>
- Near misses registered as gains will result in gamblers’ receiving positive reinforcement even when they are losing money


# Card Games

## Card Games



::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="75%"}


- Both luck and expertise

- Blackjack
  - Closest to $21$ without exceeding $21$
  - Not ***Pure Chance***
      - Counting cards <font size=4.5>[e.g., MIT blackjack team @mezrich_hacking_2002]</font>
  - Statistically possible to profit from Blackjack (unlike previous games) <br><font size=4.5>[@dedonno_poker_2008; @javarone_poker_2015; @turner_viewpoint_2008]</font>

## Card Games{.smaller}


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="75%"}


- Poker
  - Different variations
  - Aim to have highest ranked combination of cards
- Players can choose to increase the stake or to fold
- Players win either by having the highest rank of the combination
  - or by being the only person remaining
- Evidence for expertise <br><font size=4.5>[@fiedler_quantifying_2009; @hannum_legalization_2012; @dedonno_poker_2008; @javarone_poker_2015; @turner_viewpoint_2008]</font>

## Sports betting{.smaller}

- Gamblers may use statistics to inform their betting

- Not much evidence for expertise
  - Experts won more times than randomly selected betters
      - but did not win any more money <br><font size=4.5>[@ladouceur_cognitive_1998]</font>
  - Experts were just more cautious - safe bets
      - not gambling at all is likely a safer strategy <br><font size=4.5>[@ranyard_economic_2018]</font>

- Superstition
  - hot hand

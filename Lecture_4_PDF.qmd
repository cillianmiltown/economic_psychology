## Recap



### Homo Economicus?

- a rational individual 
- makes rational decisions
- that maximize utility
- is self-interested
- capable of learning from experience
- stable, consistent preferences <br>[@ranyard_economic_2018, p. 6; see also @lea_individual_1987; @warneryd_economics_2008]


## Approaches to Studying Decision Making {.smaller}



- <font color="B93B8F">Normative</font> Theories *versus* <font color="2FAACE">Behavioural</font> Theories

- <font color="B93B8F">Normative</font> (prescriptive) approaches
    + Influenced by economic and mathematical models of how decisions ***should*** be made
    + Assume people are rational
      + should make the optimal choice (the choice that best reflects the person’s preferences)
      + decisions should be consistent across settings

- <font color="2FAACE">Behavioural</font> (descriptive) approaches
    + Describe how decisions are made



## Defining Rationality {.smaller}



- Epistemic rationality
  + Rational belief or inference
  + Has a conclusion that is true
  
- Rationality of action
  + Actions (as opposed to beliefs/inferences)
  + Helps to achieve a goal


- **Instrumental rationality**
  + "our mental states or processes are rational when they help us to achieve our goals" <br>[@over_rationality_2004, p. 3]


# Expected Value / Expected Utility Theory

## Expected Value


- Which gamble would you rather play?
  + **A:** 20% chance of winning €5
  + **B:** 30% chance of winning €4

- Pick the option with the highest *Expected Value*
  + EV = probability of outcome x value of outcome

- EV(A) = 20% x €5 = €1
- EV(B) = 30% x €4 = €1.20

- **B has greater expected value**


## Problem with Expected Value

- Not every Euro has the same subjective value
  + Low income: €100 would allow person to eat better food or buy new clothes
  + High income: €100 would not need to be spent on necessities

- Lotteries
  + Pay €1 for a 1/52,000,000 chance to win €10,000,000
    + Expected value of this gamble is less than €1


## Expected Utility{.smaller}

- Utility = subjective value
  + represents whatever people want to achieve <br>[@vonneuman_theories_1947]
  
- EU = probability of outcome x utility of outcome

- Lotteries
	+ Expected utility of €1 is low - not much you can do with €1
	+ Expected utility of the prize is high - could do a lot with that kind of money
      + The low probability of winning does not completely outweigh the high utility of the prize
  + There is also the pleasure in dreaming about winning


## Predictions of Expected Utility Theory

- Choices consistent across transformations
  + a: 45% chance of €200  vs  b. 50% chance of €150
  + a: 90% chance of €200  vs  b. 100% chance of €150

- Preferences stable across measures
  + Do you prefer A or B?
  + Would you pay more for A or B?

## Bayes Theorem



$$p(y|x) = \frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}$$

# Prospect Theory

## Prospect Theory



- Kahneman & Tversky [-@kahneman_prospect_1979; -@tversky_judgment_1974] suggested a more realistic approach to describing decision making.

- Prospect theory highlights the exaggerated weighting of expected losses in people's decision making.

- Decision weights instead of probabilities
  + Decision weights are generally slightly lower than probabilities.
      + Though this changes at low probabilities.
      
## Prospect Theory



- Two people had paid a non-refundable deposit of €100 for a weekend at a resort.
  + On the way to the resort, both of them became slightly unwell, and felt they would probably have a more pleasurable time at home than at the resort.
  + Should they drive on or turn back?
  
  
## Prospect Theory - Sunk Cost



- Prediction of *loss-aversion*
- The sunk-cost effect:
  + extra expenditure in order to avoid a loss.
- This can occur even when additional expenditure is now on a less preferred option.
  + examples?

## Recall:



- Choices consistent across transformations
  + a: 45% chance of €200  vs  b. 50% chance of €150
  + a: 90% chance of €200  vs  b. 100% chance of €150


## Prospect Theory - Risk Aversion

:::{.incermental}

- *Sure* gains are chosen over *risky* but possibly greater gains.
  + This is termed **risk aversion**.

<br> 

- ***BUT***

:::

## Prospect Theory

:::{.incermental}

- Given the choice of either Option A or Option B below, which one would you go for?
  + a: A sure loss of €800
  + b: An 85% chance of losing €1000, with a 15% chance of losing nothing.

:::

## Prospect Theory - Risk Aversion/Seeking?

:::{.incermental}


- Risk aversion can be transformed into risk seeking.
  + We are more likely to take a chance to avoid a loss than we are to make a gain.

:::

## Prospect Theory - Practical applications

:::{.incermental}

- @banks_effects_1995 studied the effectiveness of two videotapes in persuading women to undergo a mammogram.


- Same medical facts presented on both tapes, but one emphasised gains of undergoing a test, the other the risks of not undergoing one.


- More of those who watched the risk-focused tape obtained a mammogram in the following 12 months.

# Social Functionalist Theory

## Social Functionalist Theory

- Tetlock [-@tetlock_social_2002] suggests that we need a more socially aware model of the decision maker.
- Rather than an intuitive *economist* or intuitive *scientist* we might consider:
  + Intuitive politician
  + Intuitive prosecutor
  + Intuitive theologian


## Booking a Holiday



- You have a chance to by a very cheap holiday to Italy, but you must today.
- You have just recently taken an exam, but you don't know yet whether you've passed or failed.
  + Buy the holiday.
  + Don't buy the holiday.
  + Pay €5 so you can still buy the holiday at the cheap price in two days time.

## Intuitive Politicians

### (making ourselves accountable)



- We are accountable to “a variety of constituencies”.
- Sometimes we must be prepared to offer explanations to maintain relationships, or maintain others' perceptions of us.
- The presence of others and the resources for explanation can affect decision making.

## Intuitive Prosecutors



- Certain contexts can trigger patterns of decision making that involve more punitive (or less lenient) actions.
- @tetlock_people_2007 found that a situation where norms have been violated lead to a range of emotional and attributional effects on decision making.
- Strong interactions with conservative vs. liberal beliefs.

## Intuitive theologians



- Being an intuitive theologian means acting as though decisions should flow from some higher authority.
- Strong ethical considerations can overwhelm base-rate information.
  - *moral outrage*

## Activity



- In Groups:
  + Please Identify an example when you acted as 
    - an intuitive politician
    - an intuitive prosecutor
    - an theologian:

## Dual Processes and Other Variables{.smaller}



- Cognitive Capacity 
  - Individual differences [@barrett_individual_2004; @brunken_assessment_2002]
  - Manipulated/nature of task [@tremoliere_cognitive_2016;@deneys_when_2007]
- Construal level and Distancing [@ayduk_distance_2010; @fujita_spatial_2006; @liberman_effect_2002; @vandijke_gross_2017]
- Need for Cognition 
  - "to engage in and enjoy effortful analytic activity" <br> [@forsterlee_examination_1999, p. 471; @cacioppo_need_1982]


## Dual-processes in Action



### Influencing Decisions

- Cognitive Load Manipulations [@deck_effect_2015]
  - Increased load inhibits <font color="2FAACE">System 2</font>
- Results
  - To more risk-averse behavior
  - More impatience over money
  - More susceptible to specific biases (anchoring effects)


## Dual-processes in Action{.smaller}



### Inhibiting Stereotypes 

- Stereotypes lead to prejudices
  - Prejudices are inevitable [@devine_stereotypes_1989]
- But not all stereotypes are *acceptable*

- <font color="FF7373">System 1</font> perceives the <font color="FF7373">stereotype</font>
  - causing the <font color="FF7373">prejudice</font>
- <font color="2FAACE">System 2</font> attempts to <font color="2FAACE">inhibit the prejudice</font>

- <font color="FF7373">Stereotypes</font> are <font color="FF7373">automatically activated</font> ***but*** <font color="2FAACE">personal beliefs</font> require <font color="2FAACE">conscious activation</font>

## Dual-processes in Action{.smaller}

### Inhibiting Stereotypes

3 Studies [@devine_stereotypes_1989]:

- Study 1:
  - Method:
    - Prejudice measured using the Modern Racism Scale [@mcconahay_has_1981]
    - Knowledge of Stereotypes measured by open-ended *"list components of stereotype"*
  - Results:
    - No relationship between stereotype knowledge and level of prejudice

## Dual-processes in Action{.smaller}



### Inhibiting Stereotypes

- Study 2:
  - Method:
    - Prejudice measured using the Modern Racism Scale 
    - Stereotypes primed using word lists
    - Judged ambiguous behaviours
  - Results:
    - Evaluation of ambiguous behaviours consistent with stereotype
    - No difference in stereotype activation for high vs low prejudice participants

## Dual-processes in Action{.smaller}



### Inhibiting Stereotypes

- Study 3:
  - Method:
    - Prejudice measured using the Modern Racism Scale 
    - Participants reported *"all of their thoughts"* on the target group
  - Results:
    - Low prejudice responses were less consistent with stereotypes than high prejudice participants
    - People can (sometimes*) monitor and inhibit the influence of automatically activated stereotypes


## Limitations of Dual-Process Theories



- Separable systems/processes? [e.g., @mugg_dualprocess_2015]
- A continuum? [e.g., @alos-ferrer_dual_2014]
- Exclusivity? Switching? [@neys_advancing_2023]
- How do they work together?


# Mental Models

## Mental Models



- Proposed by Philip Johnson-Laird [@johnson-laird_mental_1983; @johnson-laird_how_2006]

- "Mental models" are descriptions of how we represent information

- A "Mental Model" differs from a "Full model"
  - Incomplete
  - Laziness/cognitive ease

## Mental Models



You are permitted to carry out only one of the following two actions:

**Action 1**: Take the apple or the orange, or both.

**Action 2**: Take the pear or the orange, or both.

Are you permitted to take the orange?

## Uses of Mental Models



- Counterfactuals (if)
- "Logical" conclusions
- Counter examples
- Everyday reasoning

<br>

- Mental model is "generated" by System 1 but System 2 "uses" it

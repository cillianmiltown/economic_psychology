## Module Overview
Economic psychology is the study of the psychological processes that underlie economic behaviour and decision making.  It is influenced by the psychology of decision making and behavioural economics.  This module provides an overview of key concepts in economic psychology and behavioural economics.  A range of historical and contemporary theories of decision making will be covered, along with various influences on decision making, preference, and behaviour.

A primary focus of this module is the application of insights from behavioural studies to theories of decision making, and the application of these theories in predicting patterns of economic behaviour.  The ethical implications of these insights will also be explored.  The primary reading material will be taken from Ranyard (2018), Altman (2017), and Camerer, Loewenstein, & Rabin (2003). Additional reading may be found in Frantz, Chen, Dopfer, Heukelom, & Mousavi (2016) and Cartwright (2014).

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of PS4168 students should be able to:

1. Show evidence of an understanding of some of the key concepts and theories in Economic Psychology.

2. Apply findings of psychological research to everyday life and real world phenomena.
3. Synthesise their acquired knowledge to explore possible alternative solutions to practical problems.
4. Articulate and defend an informed opinion on a theoretical position.

\bigskip

*Cognitive (Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Evaluation, Synthesis)*

On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

- Describe the characteristics of economic behaviour.
- Describe theoretical models used in economic psychology.
- Critically appraise these models from a theoretical perspective with reference to empirical evidence.
- Explain major models used in economic psychology and decision making.
- Critically appraise the application of theory to real world settings.

\bigskip

*Affective (Attitudes and Values)*

On successful completion of this module, students should:

- Value the contribution that psychological research and theory building to the understanding of economic behaviour.
- Value the role of economic psychology at the individual, interpersonal and societal level.

\bigskip

*Psychomotor (Physical Skills)*

N/A



### Graduate Attributes
The learning outcomes identified above aim to contribute to each of the UL Graduate Attributes in the following ways:

*Articulate*

- This module makes use of in-class discussion/group-work as well as with written assignments.

*Agile*

- Real-world examples will be employed for illustrating the novel theoretical constructs. Furthermore, the assessments involve students identifying their own novel real-world examples.

*Courageous*

- Students will be asked to devise creative solutions to real-world problems. In-class discussions will include being challenged on, and being asked to defend a position.


*Curious*

- Self-directed learning is core to doing well in this module. Students are encouraged to read beyond the prescribed materials and explore the relevant literature to gain deeper understandings of the topics

*Responsible*

- The content of the module includes considerations of the ethical implications of the application of the concepts covered.  For example, in addition to exploring the practicalities and applications of theoretically informed interventions, the ethical considerations of such approaches will also be explored.


## Teaching and Learning Strategies

The module will be taught through lectures. The lectures will have opportunities for discussion and more in depth exploration of the material along with relevant activities to help consolidate learning. 

## Assessment

There are two parts for the assessment. There is a short task due in Week 7 (28th of October) worth 40%, and a presentation due at the end of semester (1st of December) worth 60%. Marking schemes for each assessment are provided below.  It is expected that each piece of course work will be appropriately referenced and adhere to APA standards.  Marks will not be awarded for this, however significant failure in this regard may result in a penalty of up to a sub-grade being applied.  The breakdown of marks and important deadlines are outlined in Table 1:

  \multicolumn{5}{l}{\textbf{Table 1:} Important deadlines} \\
  \hline \hline
  \textbf{Type of Assessment}               & & \textbf{\% of Final Grade} & & \textbf{Deadline} \\ \hline
  Task 1                                   & & 40\%                       & & Tuesday 28th October at 4pm \\ \hline
  Recorded Presentation                                     & & 60\%                       & & Monday 1st December at 4pm \\ \hline \end{tabular}



\bigskip

## Assessment and Grades


### Task 1
The short task will focus on individual topics as follows:

+ **Task 1** *(select one)*:
  - Heuristics
  - Game Theory

### Presentation

The presentation will require you to identify a "problem" that Economic Psychology might be able to help to solve.


Both assignments share a common marking scheme below:


\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{  >{\arraybackslash}m{10cm} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{5.5cm} }
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Table 2:} Marking scheme} \\
\hline \hline
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Percentage} \\ \hline
Clear demonstration of an in depth understanding of the topic and relevant theory & 30\% \\ \hline
Critical thinking & 30\% \\ \hline
Competence in the identification and application of relevant research methods & 20\% \\ \hline
Originality/Novelty & 20\% \\ \hline
References, Citations, and Formatting & (potential penalty of 1 sub-grade) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

### Departmental Penalty Policies: 
Late Submission of assignment: A subtraction of 5% per day from the total grade, up to 5 days, after which a mark of zero will be given. A soft copy must be uploaded by the deadline.

The Department of Psychology does not offer extensions; if you miss an assessment deadline, you must submit an M-Form with documentary evidence supporting your reason. This is considered by a committee at the end of the semester. Please carefully read the Department of Psychology Student Handbook; especially the sections relating to Mitigating Circumstances. Please note that these rules apply to all students on the module including those who register late and those from other faculties/disciplines.

Excuses: If you have a valid excuse for handing in a late assignment, or missing a lecture, please complete an M-Form and upload supporting evidence at the following link, \color{blue}[here](https://workflow.ul.ie/MForms/MForms/)\color{black}. 

### Repeat Assessment

The repeat assessment will take the same form as above.


### Feedback

Written feedback will be provided for both pieces of coursework.

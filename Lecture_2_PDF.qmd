- Two approaches to the study of decision making
  + <font color="B93B8F">Normative</font> Theories *versus* <font color="2FAACE">Behavioural</font> Theories

- Different traditions/methods

#  Biases




## Biases{.smaller}


- "An inclination towards a position or conclusion" <font size=4.5>[@reber_penguin_2001, p. 88]</font size>

- A tendency to:
  + act in a particular way
  + make judgements in a particular way

- An error in reasoning <font size=4.5>[@eysenck_cognitive_2005, p. 512]</font size>

- @todd_ecological_2012 introduce biases by analogy to optical illusions

  + "perceptual illusions are consequences of a perceptual system that is adapted to the structure of an uncertain world" <br><font size=4.5>[@todd_ecological_2012, p. 80; see also @howe_perceiving_2005]</font size>
  + "it is essential to analyze the adaptive match between cognitive and ecological structures"<font size=4.5>[@todd_ecological_2012, p. 80]</font size>


## Cognitive illusions/Cognitive biases



![concave](resources/images/bothconcaveconvex.png)



## Omission Bias{.smaller}


:::{.incremental}

- Bias for inaction over action <br><font size=4.5>[e.g., @baron_omission_2004]</font>

- Examples
  + Financial decisions
      + investments
      + pension funds
  + Medical decisions
      + vaccinations
      + dietary medication
      
- Linked to risk aversion?
:::



## The Halo Effect



- "The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect"<br>[@kahneman_thinking_2011, p. 81]

<br>

  - Political Leaders?
  - Sports people?
  - Artists/Actors?


## The Halo Effect

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWgyy_rlmag" frameborder](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWgyy_rlmag" frameborder)

## Halo Effect - Moneyball

- "Good Face"

<br>

- "Good Jaw"

<br>

- "Can he Hit"?<br><font size=4.5>[@bennett_moneyball_2011]</font size>


## Action Bias{.smaller}


- Bias for action over inaction <br>[e.g., @patt_action_2000; @bar-eli_action_2007]

- Examples
  + Government policies
      + regulating markets
      + response to crises
  + Sport
      + Goal-keepers in soccer penalties
      
- (Links with Social Functionalist Theory?)



## Wason's Rule Discovery Game{.smaller}

[@wason_failure_1960]



- I will provide a sequence of 3 numbers

- The sequence follows a simple rule

- You must identify the rule
  + You cannot ask for the rule
  + You must try guess the rule by providing your own sequence of numbers
  
<br>



<p style="text-align:center;font-size:68px">2 - 4 - 6</p>



## Results{.smaller}


- Guesses attempt to confirm hypothesised rule rather than break the rule
  + e.g.,
  + hypothesised rule: "go up in 2s"
      + $8 - 10 - 12$
      + $10 - 12 - 14$
  + hypothesised rule: "add first two numbers to get third"
      + $3 - 7 - 10$
      + $4 - 9 - 13$

- What was the rule???



## Confirmation bias


- People search for evidence to confirm their beliefs rather than to falsify them
  + Positive testing
  + Matching bias [@todd_ecological_2012, p. 324]



- Examples?
  - All swans are white
  - "This always happens to me!"
  - Queues in a shopping centre



## Syllogisms


- Deductive reasoning task:
  - a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion [@evans_two_2003]



- No police dogs are vicious
- Some highly trained dogs are vicious
  - Therefore, some highly trained dogs are not police dogs

- valid / invalid

## Syllogisms - Example 1




- No cigarettes are inexpensive.
- Some addictive things are inexpensive.
  + Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes.

## Outcome bias{.smaller}

- The "You should have known" effect

- We **blame** decision makers for *good decisions that worked out badly*

  + physicians
  + financial advisers / CEOs 
  + social workers

# Heuristics

## Heuristics{.smaller}



- "The term *heuristic* is of Greek origin, meaning *serving to find out or discover.*<br><font size=4.5>[@gigerenzer_simple_1999, p. 25]</font size>

- In 1905, Einstein published *On a heuristic point of view concerning the generation and transformation of light.*
  + (Nobel prize winning paper)
  + Einstein used the term *heuristic* to indicate that he considered the view he presented as
      + incomplete
      + false even
      + but still useful<br><font size=4.5>[@gigerenzer_simple_1999, p. 25]</font size>

## Heuristics{.smaller}

- In modern psychology, the term Heuristic has come to mean a
  - **mental shortcut** or **a rule of thumb** for decision making,
  - to help people make a quick, **satisfactory**
  - **but perhaps not perfect** answer to a complex question
  
- "A heuristic is any *rule of thumb* or simple rule of behavior by which a person solves a problem" <font size=4.5>[@cartwright_behavioral_2014, p. 33]</font size>
  + e.g., the shopper can solve their problem of what cereal to buy with the heuristic, ‘buy what I usually do’<br><font size=4.5>[@cartwright_behavioral_2014, p. 33]</font size>
  
- Domain specific <br><font size=4.5>[@gigerenzer_bounded_2002, pp. 7, 41]</font size>
  
  



## Catching a ball{.smaller}

- How does an outfielder catch a ball?
  + H1: Computing the balls trajectory?
  + H2: Gaze Heuristic
  
- H1: Trajectory computation predicts that players first estimate the point where the ball will come down, then run as fast as they can to this point and wait for the ball. <font size=4.5>[@todd_ecological_2012, p. 28]</font size>

- H2:  Gaze Heuristic predicts that players fix their gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant.
  + predicts changes in speed
  + predicts slight arc in certain situations
  
  
## Computing the Trajectory{.columns-2} 



![calculation](resources/images/gaze_calculation.png)

$\tan{\Psi} = \frac{\tan{\alpha}}{\tan{\beta}} = \frac{C_\alpha f(t)}{C_\beta f(t)} = C_\Psi$

- where $C_\alpha$, $C_\beta$ and $C_\Psi$ are constants <br>and $f(t) = t =$ time since trajectory <br> 
<font size=4.5>[taken from @mcbeath_how_1995, p. 571]</font size>

## 3D Heuristic


![3d](resources/images/3dheuristic.png)

# More General Heuristics

## Word task



- Consider the letter K.

<br>

- Is K more likely to appear as the first letter in a word OR as the third letter?
 
## Word task



- Consider the letter L.

<br>

- Is L more likely to appear as the first letter in a word OR as the third letter?
 

## Word task


- Also true for the letters N, R, V

- How did you do it?

- It is easier to come up with words using the first letter than the third letter

- More **available** examples


## The Availability Heuristic



- the process of judging frequency by “the ease with which instances come to mind”<br>[@kahneman_thinking_2011, p. 128]

<br>

- e.g., think of the number of words that can be constructed from the two sets of letters below.
  - XUZONLCJM
  - TAPCERHOB

## The Availability Heuristic{.smaller}



- Inflated Salience
  - e.g., high media coverage of:
      - Divorces among Hollywood celebrities
      - Sex scandals among politicians
  - people exaggerate the frequency of both
  
- Dramatic events
  - A plane crash that attracts media coverage will temporarily alter your feelings about the safety of flying
  - after you see a car burning at the side of the road, accidents are on your mind and the world is for a while a more dangerous place.


## The Availability Heuristic



- Personal experiences, pictures, vivid examples
  - **more available** than incidents that happen to others, mere words, or statistics
  - e.g., a judicial error that affects you will undermine your faith in the justice system more than a similar incident that you read about<br>[@kahneman_thinking_2011, p. 129]

## Practical Examples


- @ross_egocentric_1979 housework study

<br>

- First, list six instances in which you behaved assertively
  + Evaluate how assertive you are
  
- Now list 12 instances in which you behaved assertively
  + Evaluate how assertive you are<br><font size=4.5>[@schwarz_ease_1991]</font size>

## Practical Examples (continued){.smaller}


- It has been found that people:
  - believe that they use their bicycles less often after recalling many rather than few instances
  - are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it
  - are less confident that an event was avoidable after listing more ways it could have been avoided
  - are less impressed by a car after listing many of its advantages<br>[@kahneman_thinking_2011]

## Heuristics and Errors{.smaller}


- A psychologist wrote thumbnail descriptions of a sample of 1000 participants consisting of 995 females and 5 males.
The description below was chosen at random from the 1,000 available descriptions.

<br> 

- Jo is 23 years old and is finishing a degree in engineering. On Friday nights, Jo likes to go out cruising with friends while listening to loud music and drinking beer.

<br>

- Which one of the following two statements is most likely?
  - Jo is a man
  - Jo is a woman



## Representativeness Heuristic



<br>


- judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind.


## Representativeness Heuristic{.smaller}

- Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.

<br>

- Which alternative is more probable?
  - Linda is a bank teller.
  - Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
  
- Conjunction fallacy
  - (and belief bias?)



## Anchoring

- Taking information salient in the environment and using it to *anchor* your decisions

- e.g., rigged wheel of fortune: 10 or 65
  - Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just wrote?
  - What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?

- Mean response 25% and 45% (depending on 10 or 65)


## Mood Heuristic


- How happy are you these days?
- How many dates did you have last month?

- correlation?


## Mood Heuristic


- How many dates did you have last month?
- How happy are you these days?



## The Affect Heuristic


- "people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world"<br>[@kahneman_thinking_2011, p. 102]

- Substitution
  - How do I feel about it?
- serves as an answer to a much harder question
  - What do I think about it? <br>[@slovic_affect_2005; @kahneman_thinking_2011]

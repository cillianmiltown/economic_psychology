## Mental Accounting



- What is <font color="#D3D3D3">Mental</font> ***Accounting***?

:::{.incremental}

- @thaler_mental_2003 describes accounting as:
  - “*the system of recording and summarizing business and financial transactions in books, and analyzing, verifying, and reporting the results*”

:::

## Mental Accounting


- What is ***Mental*** Accounting?

:::{.incremental}

- Individuals and households also need to *record, summarize, analyze, and report the results of transactions and other financial events*

- They do so for reasons similar to those that motivate organizations to use managerial accounting: to keep trace of where their money is going, and to keep spending under control

- Mental accounting is a description of individuals do these things.

# Mental Accounting and Prospect Theory

## The Value Function (again)

## The Value Function (revisited)


![](resources/images/value_function_c.png "Value Function"){.lightbox height="420px"}

[@camerer_advances_2003, p. 636]



## The Value Function and Mental Accounting (1)

:::{.incremental}


- The value function is defined over gains and losses relative to some ***reference point***
  - This reference point is not fixed
<br>

- The focus on changes, rather than wealth levels as in expected utility theory, reflects the ***piecemeal nature of mental accounting***.

- Transactions are often evaluated one at a time, rather than in conjunction with everything else

:::

## Reference Point

![](resources/images/value_function_b.png "Value Function"){.lightbox height="420px"}

## The Value Function and Mental Accounting (2)

:::{.incremental}

- Both the gain and loss functions display ***diminishing sensitivity***

- The gain function is **concave** and the loss function is **convex**

- the difference between $10 and $20 seems bigger than the difference between $1000 and $1010
  - (irrespective of the sign)
  - (the Weber-Fechner law)
:::

## Diminishing Sensitivity


<img src="resources/images/value_function_c.png"height="420px" width="420px" align="center" />

## The Value Function and Mental Accounting (3)

:::{.incremental}


- ***Loss-aversion***

- Losing $100 hurts more than gaining $100 yields pleasure:

<br>

- $v(x) < - v(-x)$
- $v(x) <  |v(-x)|$

- The influence of loss aversion on mental accounting is enormous

# Components of Mental Accounting


## Components of Mental Accounting

:::{.incremental}

- Evaluating

<br>

- Categorisation

<br>

- Balancing<br>
[@thaler_mental_2003]

:::

## Evaluating

:::{.incremental}

- How outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and subsequently evaluated.


  - The accounting system provides the inputs to do cost—benefit analyses (both before and after decision)



-  The consumer’s choice can be understood by incorporating the value of the “deal” (termed *transaction utility*) into the purchase decision calculus.<br>
[@thaler_mental_2003]

:::

## Evaluating



>"A friend of mine was once shopping for a quilted bedspread. She went to a department store and was pleased to find a model she liked on sale. The spreads came in three sizes: double, queen and king. The usual prices for these quilts were $\$200$, $\$250$ and $\$300$ respectively, but during the sale they were all priced at only $\$150$. My friend bought the king-size quilt and was quite pleased with her purchase, though the quilt did hang a bit over the sides of her double bed" [taken from @thaler_mental_2003, p. 75]


## Categorisation

:::{.incremental}

- Assignment of activities to specific *accounts*
  - Both **sources** and **uses** of funds are labeled in real and mental accounting systems

- Expenditures grouped into categories (housing, food, etc.)
  - Spending can be constrained by implicit or explicit budgets
- Funds to spend are also labeled, both as flows (regular income versus windfalls) and as stocks (cash on hand, home equity, pension wealth, etc.) [@thaler_mental_2003]

:::

## Categorisation



> "A few years ago I gave a talk to a group of executives in Switzerland. After the conference my wife and I spent a week visiting the area. At that time the Swiss franc was at an all-time high relative to the US dollar, so the usual high prices in Switzerland were astronomical. My wife and I comforted ourselves that I had received a fee for the talk that would easily cover the outrageous prices for hotels and meals. Had I received the same fee a week earlier for a talk in New York though, the vacation would have been much less enjoyable" [taken from @thaler_mental_2003, p. 75]


## Categorisation



> "A former colleague of mine, a professor of finance, prides himself on being a thoroughly rational man. Long ago he adopted a clever strategy to deal with life’s misfortunes. At the beginning of each year he establishes a target donation to the local United Way charity. Then, if anything untoward happens to him during the year, for example an undeserved speeding ticket, he simply deducts this loss from the United Way account. He thinks of it as an insurance policy against small annoyances" [taken from @thaler_mental_2003, p. 75]



## Balancing{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Frequency with which accounts are evaluated
  - **choice bracketing**<br> [@read_choice_2000]
  
- Accounts can be balanced daily, weekly, yearly, and so on
  - defined narrowly or broadly
  
- [A well-known song](https://youtu.be/7hx4gdlfamo?t=82)
  - “never count your money while you’re sitting at the table”
  - Excellent advice, in poker as well as in other situations involving decision making under uncertainty (such as investing).

- Balancing also involves opening and closing of mental accounts
<br>
[@thaler_mental_2003]

:::

## Accounting vs Mental Accounting

:::{.incremental}


- Mental accounting rules not neutral

- Attractiveness of choices influenced by:
  - Which category a purchase is assigned to
  - Combining outcomes with others in that category
  - Frequency the 'books' are 'balanced'
  
- Mental accounting violates the economic notion of *fungibility*
  - (units are interchangeable)

:::

# Decision Frames

## Decision Frames{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Framing of outcomes <br> ['outcome frames' @kahneman_choices_2000; 'entries' @thaler_mental_2003]
  - Minimal account
      - only the differences between the two options (disregarding all their common features)
  - Topical account
      - consequences of possible choices to a reference level that is determined by the context within which the decision arises
  - Comprehensive account
      - all (other) factors including current wealth, future earnings, possible outcomes of other probabilistic holdings etc.

## Recap activity

- Individually or in groups
  - List the three key components of mental accounting
  - Revise key elements of the value function
  - Identify different mental accounts that you use

## Recap{.smaller}



- Three key components of mental accounting:
  - Evaluating
  - Categorisation
  - Balancing

- Key elements of the value function:
  - Loss aversion
  - Gain function is **concave**
  - Loss function is **convex**
  - Diminishing sensitivity
  - Reference point


## Hedonic Framing



- (Maximise pleasure/minimise pain)

- Individually/In groups:
  - How should joint outcomes be evaluated to maximise utility?
  - Use your knowledge of the value function:
      - Shape of gain function vs loss function
      - Diminishing sensitivity
      - Loss aversion



## Principles of Hedonic Framing{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

1. Segregate gains <br><font size=4.5>(because the gain function is concave)</font>
2. Integrate losses <br><font size=4.5>(because the loss function is convex)</font>
3. Integrate smaller losses with larger gains <br><font size=4.5>(to offset loss aversion)</font>
4. Segregate small gains (silver linings) from larger losses <br><font size=4.5>(because the gain function
is steepest at the origin, the utility of a small gain can exceed the utility of slightly reducing a large loss)<br>[@thaler_mental_2003, p. 79]</font>

- Application of these principles in marketing?
  - rebate *vs* temporary price reduction

:::

## Hedonic Framing and Mental Accounting{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Do people apply these principles?
  - Do people edit/parse multiple outcomes "optimally"?
      - ***Hedonic Editing***

- Hedonic Editing as the application of the following rule:
  - $$v(x \& y) = Max[v ( x + y ), v( x ) + v( y )]$$
- But in the case of the jacket:
  - $\$5$ dollar gain ...
      - $5 \times \$1$ gain?

:::

## Hedonic Editing Hypothesis

:::{.incremental}

- @thaler_gambling_1990:
  - two specified financial outcomes:
  - e.g.,  a gain/loss of $\$30$ followed by a loss/gain of $\$9$
  - who would be happier, someone who had these two events occur on the same day, or a week or two apart? 
- Predictions?
  - Segregate Gains
  - Integrate losses
  
:::

## Hedonic Editing Hypothesis: Results

:::{.incremental}

- Participants viewed segregation of Gains as optimal  &#10004;

- Participants also viewed segregation of Losses as optimal  &#x2717;
  - No clear reason why
      - Losses cannot be "*combined*"?
 
:::

 
## Hedonic Framing and Mental Accounting{.smaller}



- The rules of hedonic framing are good descriptions of the way people would ***like*** to have the world organized<br><font size=4.5>(many small gains including silver linings; losses avoided if possible but otherwise combined)</font>
- People will also actively parse outcomes consistent with these rules, **with the exception of multiple losses**

- Implications:
  - Mental accounting should be as hedonically efficient as possible
      - Opportunities to combine losses with larger gains will be exploited wherever feasible
  - Loss aversion is even more important than the prospect theory value function would suggest<br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_mental_2003, p. 81]</font>


## Mental Accounting Decision-Making



- Two kinds of utility from a purchase:
  - Acquisition Utility
  - Transaction Utility

  - *Md*~store~  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp; $1.50

- People are willing to pay more for the beer from the resort
  - The reference price in that context is higher
  
- This effect cannot be accommodated in a standard economic model:
  - Consumption experience is the same in either case
  - Place of purchase should be irrelevant
- ***Transaction Utility***: difference beetween amount paid and *reference price*


## Mental Accounting Decision-Making{.smaller}

- Acquisition Utility
   - Measure of the value of the good obtained relative to its price
   - Similar to the economic concept of consumer surplus
   - Value the consumer would place on receiving the good as a gift, minus the price paid.
   
- Transaction Utility
  - Perceived value of the “*deal*”
  - Difference between the amount paid and the ‘reference price’ for the good
      - (the regular price that the consumer expects to pay for this product)<br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_mental_2003, pp. 81-82]</font>

# Opening and Closing Accounts

## Missing the Festival



- Cost becomes a Loss
  - Losses are aversive
      - Sunk costs?
- Thaler [@thaler_mental_2003; -@thaler_positive_1980]
  - Going to a basketball game in a blizzard





## Advance Purchase{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Consider paying $100 for two tickets to a basketball game to be held in a month’s time

- Tickets at *reference price* (transaction utility is Zero)

- An account is opened at the point at which the tickets are purchased
  - Negative balance of $100
  - Once the date of the game comes and the game is attended, the account can be closed

- If the game is missed (due to blizzard)
  - account is closed at a loss of $100
  
- Why does the prior expenditure (now a sunk cost) makes someone more willing to go to the game in a blizzard?

:::

## Evaluating Purchases

:::{.incremental}

- Lost ticket vs Lost equivalent sum of money<br>[@kahneman_choices_2000; @heath_escalation_1995; @thaler_mental_2003]

- Suppose you buy a pair of shoes
  - Perfectly comfortable in the shop
      - First day you wear them they hurt
      - A few days later  &#8594; try again  &#8594; still hurt (even more)
      
- Predictions?

:::

## Painful Shoes{.smaller}



1. The more you paid for the shoes, the more times you will try to wear them. (This choice may be rational, especially if they have to be replaced with another expensive pair)
2. Eventually you stop wearing the shoes, but you do not throw them away. The more you paid for the shoes, the longer they sit in the back of your closet before you throw them away. (This behavior cannot be rational unless expensive shoes take up less space)
3. At some point, you throw the shoes away, regardless of what they cost, the payment having been fully “depreciated.”<br><font size=4.5>[@thaler_mental_2003, p. 84]</font>

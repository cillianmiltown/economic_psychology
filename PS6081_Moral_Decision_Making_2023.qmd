## Known Influences on Moral Judgements {.smaller}

#### ... some of them anyway...

- Emotional influences [e.g., @cameron_morality_2013]
- Intentionality, Evitability, benefit recipient [@christensen_moral_2014; @christensen_moral_2012]
- Action-outcome distinction [@crockett_models_2013; @cushman_action_2013]
- Trustworthiness and social evaluation [@everett_inference_2016; @everett_costs_2018]
- Personal-impersonal distinction [@greene_fmri_2001]
- Doctrine of double effect [@mikhail_rawls_2000]
- Level of physical contact [@valdesolo_manipulations_2006]
- Order effects [@wiegmann_order_2012]



# Understanding this complexity


## Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Development

- ***Preconventional Morality*** (stages 1 & 2): people follow unvarying rules based on rewards and punishments
- ***Conventional Morality*** (stages 3 & 4) is where people approach problems in terms of their own position as good, responsible members of society
- ***Postconventional Morality*** (stages 5 & 6) is where universal moral principles are invoked and considered broader than a particular society [@kohlberg_stages_1969; @kohlberg_ought_1971]


## Heinz{.smaller}

In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one
drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a
druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to
make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make.
He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The
sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money,
but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told
the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay
later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make
money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal
the drug-for his wife. Should the husband have done that? (Kohlberg, 1963, p. 19)

## Heinz

Should the husband have done that?


## Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Development

- moral “dilemmas”; a person’s level of moral reasoning assessed by evaluating reasoning behind response

## Stages{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

\scriptsize
- At **stage 1** children think of what is right as that which authority says is right. Doing the right thing is **obeying authority and avoiding punishment**. (\color{sentiment}do not steal\color{black})
- At **stage 2**, children are no longer so impressed by any single authority; they see that there are different sides to any issue. Since everything is relative, one is free to **pursue one's own interests**, although it is often **useful to make deals and exchange favors** with others. (\color{rational}steal\color{black})
- At stages 3 and 4, young people think as **members of the conventional society with its values**, norms, and expectations
  - \scriptsize At **stage 3**, they emphasize being a **good person**, which basically means having helpful motives toward people close to one. (\color{rational}steal\color{black})
  - \scriptsize At **stage 4**, the concern shifts toward obeying laws to **maintain society as a whole** (\color{sentiment}do not steal\color{black})

:::

## Stages{.smaller}  

:::{.incremental}

- At stages 5 and 6 people are less concerned with maintaining society for it own sake, and **more concerned with the principles and values that make for a good society**
  - \scriptsize At stage 5 they emphasize basic rights and the democratic processes that give everyone a say
  - \scriptsize Stage 6 they define the principles by which agreement will be most just.

## Reasoning Stage and Age


![](resources/images/moral_reasoning.png)

\includegraphics[width=.98\textwidth]{images/moral_reasoning.png}


## Kohlberg Criticisms{.smaller}

Suggestions???

:::{.incremental}

- **Based solely on observations of members of Western cultures**

- Non-Western cultures do not fit well with Kohlberg’s approach
  - Although justice is an important moral concept around the world,
  - Justice does not supersede all other moral considerations in non-Western cultures

- Provides good account of moral judgment but not adequate at predicting moral behavior
- Theory initially based largely on data from males

:::




## Carol Gilligan – Emotion & Gender{.smaller}

- Ethics based on caring for others and on maintaining social relationships are important

- **Justice** and **care** are two distinct orientations

- Way boys and girls raised leads to differences in moral reasoning

- Boys view morality primarily in terms of justice and fairness.

- Girls see morality in terms of responsibility and compassion toward individuals and a willingness to sacrifice for relationships.

- Suggests Kohlberg’s theory inadequate and places girls’ moral reasoning at
lower level than boys’

## Haidt's Social Intuitionist Model

![](resources/images/SIM_cover.png)

[@haidt_emotional_2001]


## Haidt's Social Intuitionist Model{.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Too much focus on reasons/principles
- Automatic/intuitive nature of moral judgements not addressed


- How do you feel about the following?
  - Family decide to cook & eat their dog (family pet) after it is killed in a road traffic accident
  - Using the Irish flag to clean the floor in the bathroom [@haidt_affect_1993]

## Julie and Mark{.smaller}

> Julie and Mark, who are brother and sister, are travelling
together in France. They are both on summer vacation from
college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the
beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they
tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for
each of them. Julie was already taking birth control pills, but
Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but
they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special
secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to
each other [@haidt_moral_2000; @mchugh_searching_2017a].

## Jennifer{.smaller}

> Jennifer works in a medical school pathology lab as a research assistant.
The lab prepares human cadavers that are used to teach medical
students about anatomy. The cadavers come from people who had
donated their body to science for research. One night Jennifer is leaving
the lab when she sees a body that is going to be discarded the next day.
Jennifer was a vegetarian, for moral reasons. She thought it was wrong to
kill animals for food. But then, when she saw a body about to be
cremated, she thought it was irrational to waste perfectly edible meat. So
she cut off a piece of flesh, and took it home and cooked it. The person
had died recently of a heart attack, and she cooked the meat thoroughly,
so there was no risk of disease [@haidt_moral_2000; @mchugh_searching_2017a].

## Moral Dumbfounding

:::{.incremental}

- People typically react with moral disgust to these scenarios and yet they struggle to explain why

- Know as moral dumbfounding **(PLAY VIDEO)**

- Supports the idea that we have an inbuilt(?) moral **intuition** divorced from reason

- Gave rise to intuitionist theories of moral judgement

:::

## Existing Approaches {.smaller}

> - **Moral Emotions**: @prinz_passionate_2005
>   - *'Emotions, I will suggest are perceptions of our bodily states. To recognise the moral value of an event is, thus, to perceive the perturbation that it causes'* [@prinz_passionate_2005, p. 99]
> - **Social Intuitionist Model** [@haidt_emotional_2001]
>   - e.g., intuitions as phonemes [@haidt_emotional_2001, p. 827]
>   - ‘brain has a kind of gauge’, a ‘like-ometer’ [@haidt_social_2008, p. 187]

> - **Theory of Dyadic Morality**: [@gray_mind_2012; @schein_theory_2018]
>   - Content focused (rather than underlying processes)

> - **Dual Process Theories**: [e.g., @greene_secret_2008]
>   - 'Emotion' vs 'Cognition' (not well defined)

## Challenges to Moral Dumbfounding {.smaller}

- Failure to provide reasons does not mean there are no reasons [@sneddon_social_2007]
- People implicitly perceive harm [@gray_myth_2014]
- People have do have reasons but are “beaten into submission” [@jacobson_moral_2012] 
- Evidence for principles or reasons guiding judgements
  - Harm based Norm based [@royzman_curious_2015]
    - Excluding participants who endorsed either principle
      - Moral Dumbfounding effectively disappeared…

## Responding to Challenges {.smaller}


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- People do not consistently articulate or apply harm or norm-based reasons [@mchugh_reasons_2020]
- Demonstrably more accurate exclusion criteria
  - fewer false exclusions<br>(<8% from >50%)
- Interesting order effect

> *"it is wrong for two people to engage in an activity whereby harm may occur"*

### Premises

- Moral judgment is a process of **categorizing** as *MORALLY RIGHT* / *MORALLY WRONG*

- **Domain general**

- **Context sensitive** & **Dynamical**, **Goal-Directed Activity**

### Core Predictions

- *Stability* emerges through continued and consistent type-token interpretation

- *Robustness* emerges through consistency across multiple contexts

## Bus {.smaller}

> You are visiting a city where there have recently been terrorist suicide bombings. The terrorists target crowded buses or subway cars. To prevent anyone stopping them, they run up at the last moment when the bus or subway doors are closing, triggering their bomb as they enter. You are on a crowded bus at rush hour, just getting off at your stop. Next to you a large man is also getting off, and the doors are about to close behind the two of you. You spot a man with an overcoat rushing at the doors, aiming to enter just behind the exiting man. Under his coat you see bombs strapped to his chest, and his finger is on a trigger. If you were to push the large man hard in the direction of the approaching man, they both would fall onto the sidewalk, where the bomb would explode, killing both. You would have fallen back onto the bus, and the closing doors would protect you and the other occupants of the bus from the bomb. Alternatively, you could continue exiting the bus, and you and the large man would be on sidewalk, protected by the closing doors, as the bomb goes off inside the bus, killing the terrorist and five passengers. Either way, then, you will not be hurt. Should you push the large man onto the bomber?


## Wave {.smaller}

> A runaway trolley is speeding down the track, its driver slumped over the controls, apparently unconscious. Ahead on the tracks are five workers, who do not see the trolley coming, and who soon will be struck and killed. A wall prevents them from moving to their left to avoid the trolley, but there is space to their right. You are standing at some distance from the track, with no ability to turn the train. The workers are facing in your direction, and if you were to wave to their right with your arms, the five workers on the track would step off and escape injury. However, a single worker who is closer to you and standing to the left of the track, and who also does not see the trolley, will see you wave, and he will step onto the track, and immediately be hit and killed. Should you wave to the workers?

## Beckon {.smaller}

> A runaway trolley is speeding down the track, its driver slumped over the controls, apparently unconscious. Ahead on the tracks are five workers, who do not see the trolley coming, and who soon will be struck and killed. You are standing at some distance from the track, with no ability to turn the train or warn the men. A large man, whose weight is sufficient to stop the trolley, is standing on the other side of the track, facing in your direction. He is unable to see the oncoming trolley owing to a traffic signal box that blocks his view up the track. If you would beckon to him, he would step forward onto the track, and be immediately struck and killed. This would halt the trolley and save the five workers. Should you beckon to the large man?

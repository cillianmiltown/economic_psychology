## Breakdown{.smaller}

*Content*

The assignment should directly address the question asked and demonstrate a clear coherent argument throughout.  Excessive descriptions should be avoided if they do not serve to support an argument.  Evidence of critical thinking is essential.  Students should demonstrate evidence of wider reading and understanding of the concepts being discussed.

*Stucture, Language, and Written Expression*

Ideas should be clearly expressed, with appropriate use of scientific language.  There should be a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, with appropriate use of paragraphs (The use of sub-headings is optional). 

*References, Citations, and Formatting*

In-text citations and the References section should be in APA style. All citations should appear in the References section, and all references should be cited in the text. A References section should be included.

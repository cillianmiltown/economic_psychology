## Introduction to Game Theory

  

- Branch of Applied Mathematics
  - Provides a framework for modelling and predicting behaviour in Social situations of 
      - cooperation
      - coordination
      - conflict <br><font size=4.5>[@dowling_modern_2007; @vonneuman_theory_1944; @vonneuman_theories_1947]</font>

# The Prisoner Dilemma

## The Prisoner Dilemma

  

- Two suspects (e.g., <font color="#6666ff">Bob</font> and <font color="#ff4c4c">Susan</font>) are arrested on suspicion of a serious crime

- However:
  - Only sufficient evidence to convict them of a minor crime
  
- Prisoners are kept in isolation and offered a deal:
  - If neither confess they each get 1 year
  - If one confesses and the other doesn't the one that confessed will be let free and the other is sentenced for 20 years
  - If they both confess they each get 5 years

## Strict Dominance

  

- The strategy x is a **dominant** strategy if it is a *strict best response* to any feasible strategy that the others might play
- We say that a strategy x strictly dominates strategy y for a player if
  - strategy x provides a greater payoff for that player than strategy y
  - regardless of what the other player(s) do.

<br>

- What is the dominant strategy in the Prisoner Dilemma?


## Combining the Options

  

This leaves `<confess><confess>` as the ***Rational*** outcome

## Some Alternatives to the Prisoner Dilemma

  

- Import Tax

- Advertising

- International Relations<br><font size=4.5>[taken from @spaniel_game_2013]</font>

- Any other examples?

## Import Tax

  

- Should countries introduce tax on imports/trading tariffs?
- Placing tariffs (a tax) on imported goods can
  - protect domestic industries 
  - though this leads to higher prices overall
- The best outcome for a country is to tax imports while not having the other country tax its exports.
- Free trade is the next best outcome
- Mutual tariffs is the next best outcome
  - ultimately, this leads to higher prices than the free trade outcome
- The worst possible outcome is to levy no taxes while the other country enforces a tariff



## Import Tax

  


\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/importtax.png}


## Advertising

  

- Consider two rival firms considering whether to advertise their products
- Would the firms ever want the government to pass a law forbidding advertisement?
- If advertising campaigns only persuade a consumer to buy a certain **brand** of product *rather than the product in general*
  - If one side places ads and the other does not, the firm with the advertising campaign cuts into the other’s share of the market.
  - If they both advertise, the ads cancel each other out, but they still have to pay for the campaigns.

## Advertising

  
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/advertising.png}


## Going to War

  

- Should two states go to war?
- Peace is preferable to war
- BUT
  - Striking first leads to a large advantage
  - Being struck first is very costly
      - Striking at the same time as opponent is preferable to being attacked

## Asymmetric Games

  
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/assymetric.png}



## Another Asymmetric Game

  

- Two Clubs <font color="#6666ff">ONE</font> and <font color="#ff4c4c">TWO</font> in a town
- Will run either a Salsa night or a Disco night
- <font color="#6666ff">ONE</font> is centrally located but <font color="#ff4c4c">TWO</font> is outside the town
  - If <font color="#ff4c4c">TWO</font> runs the same night as <font color="#6666ff">ONE</font> nobody will show

- Three types of customers
  - 60 hardcore Salsa fans - will only go to Salsa
  - 20 hardcore Disco fans - will only go to Disco 
  - 20 people prefer going to a disco theme but will attend a salsa night if that is the only option

# Different types of Games

## Stag Hunt

  

- Two hunters enter a range filled with hares and a single stag
  - Hares are easy to capture
      - but not worth much meat (1)
  - Catching the stag requires working together
      - worth much more meat (6 - to share between 2)
  
- If they both hunt hares, they each capture half of the hares in the range
- If one hunts the stag and the other hunts hares
  - the stag hunter goes home empty-handed
  - the hare hunter captures all of the hares
- If both hunt the stag, they share the stag (value of the stag is greater than the value of all of the hares)

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/stag.png}


## No Strict Dominace in the Stag Hunt?

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/stag2.png}

## No Strict Dominace in the Stag Hunt?

- **Nash equilibrium**
  - a set of strategies, one for each player
  - no player has incentive to change his or her strategy (given what the other players are doing)
  
- **Nash equilibrium** is the best strategy given the strategy chosen by the other participants<br><font size=4.5>[@dowling_modern_2007]</font size>

- Individuals have no incentive to deviate (not group deviations)
  - no regrets at the end of the game
    - once the other player's strategy has been revealed
    
- Nash equilibria are ***inherently stable***


## Nash Equilibria in real life

  

- Traffic
  - Traffic Lights
  - Driving on the Left/Right
  - Other Examples?

# Matching Pennies

## Matching Pennies

  

- 2 players have a penny
- Each put penny down either Heads up or Tails up
- If both show heads or both show tails (they match) <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> wins
- If one shows heads and the other shows tails (they do not match) <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> wins

<br>

- Strictly competitive / *zero sum* game
- Players actively want the opponent to perform poorly

## Matching Pennies

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/pennies.png}


## Matching Pennies and Nash Equilibrium

  

- Every finite game has a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies

- **Nash Existence Theorem**: If each player in an *n*-player game has a finite number of pure strategies, then the game has a (not necessarily unique) Nash equilibrium in (possibly) mixed strategies <br><font size=4.5>[@gintis_game_2009, p. 44]</font size>

- If I could read your mind, how would you beat me at Matching Pennies?

- mixed strategy refers to how we are randomizing over multiple strategies (across multiple trials) rather than playing a single “pure” strategy. 


# Mixed Strategy Algorithm

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/mixedalg.png}

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

- In matching pennies, flipping against the mind reader was intended to make the Expected Utility of each of the opponents strategies the same
  - Calculate best strategy for <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font>
      - $EU_L = EU_R$
  
- $EU_L = f(\sigma_u)$
- $EU_R = f(\sigma_u)$

- Express - $EU_L$ and $EU_R$ in terms of $\sigma_u$ and solve for $\sigma_u$

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

Expected Utility of Left



- $EU_L$ is -3 sometimes (when <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> plays Up) and 1 the rest of the time

- $EU_L = \sigma_u(-3) + (1-\sigma_u)(1)$

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

Expected Utility of Right



- $EU_R$ is 2 sometimes (when <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> plays Up) and 0 the rest of the time 

- $EU_R = \sigma_u(2) + (1-\sigma_u)(0)$

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

- Let $$EU_L = EU_R$$

- $$\sigma_u(-3) + (1-\sigma_u)(1) = \sigma_u(2) + (1-\sigma_u)(0)$$

- $$-3\sigma_u + 1 - \sigma_u = 2\sigma_u + 0$$

- $$6\sigma_u = 1$$

- $$\sigma_u = \frac{1}{6}$$

- If <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> plays Up $\frac{1}{6}$ of time <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> is indifferent between Left and Right

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

- Calculate <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2's</font> best strategy using the same calculation but letting 
  - $EU_u = f(\sigma_L)$
  - $EU_d = f(\sigma_L)$
- and solving for $\sigma_L$

- Yields $$\sigma_L = \frac{1}{3}$$

## Mixed Strategy Algorithm

  

Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:



- $\sigma_u = \frac{1}{6} , \sigma_L = \frac{1}{3}$



## Number Beauty Contest

  

- Everyone picks a number between $1$ and $100$

- Everyone's response is collated to [calculate the Mean](https://www.easycalculation.com/statistics/mean-median-mode.php)

- The Mean is multiplied by a constant $\frac{2}{3}$

- Congratulations if you picked the *most beautiful number*


## Strategy for the Number Beauty Contest

- Midpoint of $1$ and $100$ is $50$
  - Mean of uniformly drawn sample is $50$
  - $\frac{2}{3}$ of $50$ is $`r round(50*(2/3), digits=2)` . . .$
- Best strategy is to guess around $33.33$ . . .   ? 

<br>

- Everyone guessing $~33$ brings the Mean closer to $33$
  - ***BUT***  $\frac{2}{3}$ of $33$ is $`r round((50*(2/3))*(2/3), digits=2)` . . .$

- Best strategy to guess around $22$. . . ?<br><font size=4.5>[@keynes_general_1936; @dowling_modern_2007]</font size>




## Basic Ultimatum Game (Dictator Version 1)

<br>

- <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> receives €100

- <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> may divide the €100 between you and <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> however you like.

- End of the Game

- What is the ***rational*** choice?

- <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> can accept or reject the offer

- End of the Game

- What is the ***rational*** choice?
  - for <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font>
  - for <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font>

## Fairness vs Rationality

## Backward Induction

  

- Sum of money to be divided between <font color="#ff4c4c">Ann</font> and <font color="#6666ff">Ben</font> 
- <font color="#ff4c4c">Ann</font> starts with 100p and can give some to <font color="#6666ff">Ben</font> 
- <font color="#6666ff">Ben</font> can accept or reject
  - if <font color="#6666ff">Ben</font> rejects:
      - Money is reduced to 25p and <font color="#6666ff">Ben</font>  is in charge of dividing the money
  
- <font color="#ff4c4c">Ann</font> can accept or reject
  - if <font color="#ff4c4c">Ann</font> rejects, both receive nothing

<font size=4.5>[taken from @dowling_modern_2007, p. 118]</font size>


## Backward Induction and the Centipede Game

  

- A dime (10c) is put on the table
- <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> has the option to take it
- If <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> leaves it, another dime is placed on top and <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> has the option to take it
- If <font color="#6666ff">Player 2</font> leaves it another dime is added
  - and so on. . .

## Backward Induction and the Centipede Game

  

- Assume there are 10 rounds, this will leave $1 on the table at <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2's</font> decision
  - Final round, <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> will take the money
- By backwards induction <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> should take at round 9
  - but <font color="#ff4c4c">Player 2</font> should anticipate this and take the money at round 8
      an so on. . .

- Nash Equilibrium is for <font color="#6666ff">Player 1</font> to take the dime on round 1
  - Without prior collusion participants have waited till the last round and split the money




## Beyond Individual Games

  

- Game theory works for investigating behvaiour at the individual level

<br>

- Can also be used to test the emergence of ***best*** or ***most robust*** strategies through computer simulations

<br>

- The effectiveness of strategies relative to each other can be established

## Repeated Trials of the Prisoner Dilemma

  

- @axelrod_evolution_1984 famously simulated the Prisoner Dilemma using a points system

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{resources/images/prisoner3.png}

## Repeated Trials of the Prisoner Dilemma

  

- A "tournament" for strategies was devised and the winner was ***Tit for Tat***
  - Initially offer cooperation
  - Respond to defection with defection
  - Observed during WW1

- @nowak_arithmetics_1995 used learning algorithms
  - cooperation eventually prevailed 
      - *generous tit for tat* (failed to retaliate occasionally)
      - *Pavlov*
